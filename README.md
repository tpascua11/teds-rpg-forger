# maker-dragon-book (text rpg maker inspired by RPG Maker XP)

# Project Description

I wanted to create a text adventure RPG version of the RPG Maker XP program.

I was a huge fan of the RPG Maker XP system; I spent my whole middle school and half of high school years just making an RPG. I created my own sprites, animations, class concepts, enemies, and dialogues. What I was really invested in was the conditional and event-calling aspects in the engine. I even tried to implement a day and night system, experimenting with the parallel event system in the game, and I believe that's where I gained a strong grasp on semaphores.

This project aimed to build a text adventure RPG version following the same pursuit as when I was young. However, I underestimated how challenging it would be to organize everything and make it look neat while ensuring each function works seamlessly.

One of my favorite features of this app is being able to create complicated conditional script just like RPG Maker XP, and it even includes a drag row function.

After working on this project, I came to realize something about game data â€” the concept of Entities and Groupings. This realization prompted me to wrap up what I could achieve here and move on to the second project. 

The old project can be used here --  [old-project](https://teds-rpg-forger.web.app/#/).
